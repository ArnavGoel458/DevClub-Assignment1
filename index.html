         <div class="rectangle7"></div>
         <h4 class="question1">How does the Virus spread</h4><p class="answer1">COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.</p>
         <div class="rectangle8"></div>
         <h4 class="question2">What should i do if i get sick or someone in my house gets sick</h4>
         <ul class="list1">
             <li>People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms.</li>
             <li>People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.</li>
             <li>People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms.</li>
         </ul>
         <div class="rectangle9"></div>
         <h4 class="question3">What is Omicron and what makes it a variant of concern (VoC) </h4>
        <p class="d1"> It is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has recently been reported from South
            Africa on 24th November 2021 called as B.1.1.529 or Omicron (based on Greek
            alphabets like alpha, beta, delta etc). This variant has shown a very large
            number of mutations, especially more than 30 on the viral spike protein, which
            is the key target of the immune response.
            Given the collection of mutations in Omicron, which earlier individually have
            been associated with increased infectivity and/or immune evasion, and the
            sudden rise in number of positive cases in South Africa, World Health
            Organization has declared Omicron as a Variant of Concern (VoC)<br><br>
